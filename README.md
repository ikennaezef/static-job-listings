## Overview

This project displays a list of developer jobs available according to given/available data. It first pulls data from a local data.json file and then displays the available jobs on the page with the roles, time posted, location, level, languages, tools and so on. These jobs can then be filtered by clicking on the tags for each job.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories
